;; ****************************************************************
;; code to implement command-click.
;; Command Click copies what you are pointing to where you are typing.

;; Implementation:

;; Each type of view which wants to be able to contribute text defines two methods
;; (give-text? view)   -> t if you can supply text
;; (give-text view)    -> The text which is to be copied.

;; Additionally the view-click-event-handler should arrange to call
;; (maybe-click-to-copy from-window to-window position continuation)
;; where continuation is called if the click wasn't a command click,
;; or if it was but there was no text to copy.

;; Currently the methods for editable-text, dialog-item, sequence-dialog-item, and
;; fred-mixin do this by advising the around method for view-click-event-handler.
;; Also, the window-select-event-handler is also advised, so that you can command click
;; another to copy from another window.
